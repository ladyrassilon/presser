Important Update 0.1.8
======================

Vine has changed their video URL structure so now URLs are passed in as a list.

So if you were using the "videoUrl" key, to get the equivalent URL in the new structure.
    
.. code:: python

    # You'll need to instead of going to.
    vine["videoUrl"]
    # You'll need to go to
    vine["videoUrls"][0]["videoUrl"]


This is a simple library that attempts to extract the data for a vine from a given vine.co URL. Its a little rough and ready, and given that Vine can change their page design at any time, cannot be guaranteed to work.

You'll want to keep an eye out for PresserJavaScriptParseError because this will probably indicate that this is the case.

You will need Node installed, it does the evaluation of the javascript for more stable javascript data extraction. I am looking to find a viable alternative so the package will not be node dependent, but as yet, I've not found a viable alternative.

| However, here is the example usage::

.. code:: python

    from presser.presser import Presser
    press = Presser()

    #For a vine id
    vine = press.get_data_for_vine_id("OBiwWuBm0Eg")
    
    #For a vine url
    vine = press.get_data_for_vine_from_url("https://vine.co/v/OBiwWuBm0Eg")
    
    vine.keys()
    vine["avatarUrl"]
    
Warning
^^^^^^^
Vine does not permit scraping, so please do not use this in an automated fashion, but it should be okay if your workflow simplifies and speeds up the workflow of a user going to an url and extracting the data manually. 

| If you try to do large batches of vine urls for extraction in a short period of time, then you will probably annoy Vine. Don't do this please.
